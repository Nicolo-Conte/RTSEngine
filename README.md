# RTSEngine
RTS Engine it’s a Tech Demo of a custom Engine for developing 2D RTS games on PC
This repository contains the gameplay classes of the university project: Custom RTS Engine.
The Visual Studio project cannot be run since the files inherent to the Engine are missing, 
so this repository is for demonstration use only.
